        <h4>Backstory</h4>
        <p>Once upon a time, in Rhode Island, there was born a child. He loved to learn and worked hard all
          throughout primary and secondary school. His hard work paid off, and he was admitted
          to Dartmouth College.</p><br>
          <p>Where will his story go from here?</p>
          <p> Only time will tell.</p><br><br><br>

        <h4>Present Day</h4>
        <p>Hunter Gallant is currently Class of 2021 at Dartmouth College. He enjoys coding,
        reading, playing video games, and learning as much random information as he can. Hunter
        knows he wants to go into computer science after college, but he can't decide between
        cyber security, artificial intelligence, and video game design.</p><br>
        <p>I'm sure he'll figure it out soon enough.</p>
